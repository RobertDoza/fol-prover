# Interactive FOL theorem prover
This is an interactive theorem prover for first-order logic (FOL) using natural deduction. It tries to imitate the syntax of proving natural deduction theorems that is used by the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant.

## System requirements
The program is designed to run on the Linux operating system. To compile the program, one needs to have the `g++` C++ compiler and the `flex` and `bison` parsing tools installed on their system.

## Setup
The program is compiled by running the `make` command. This will build the application `prover`, that can be run in the terminal.

## Usage
